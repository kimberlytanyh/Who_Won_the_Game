## Who Won the Game?

In this repository, you will find an interactive program simulating a bowling game, created in a Jupyter Notebook. In this program, users are asked to enter the number of players and the name of players. From there, game scores are randomly assigned by the program and stored in a scorecard.txt file, which is used to display scores and compute final game results to determine which player won the game.

A breakdown of the program components and download-free access to the program via Google Colab can be found on [my Wix website portfolio](https://kimberlytanyh.wixsite.com/portfolio).
